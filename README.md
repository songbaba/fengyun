# Android ViewPager With Vertical Scroll

## Description
A code demo to show one single parallax top image with a sticky toolbar, with a viewpager hosting fragments with scrollview and listview. The top image and sticky toolbar will be preserved when the user scrolls horizontally through the viewpager.

The code is based loosely from the snippets in http://nerds.airbnb.com/host-experience-android/ The differences are due to the inability to get the snippets to work as expected. 

## Caveat
1. If one of the scrollable fragments does not contain enough elements for a full page scroll, the sticky toolbar will be translated back to the appropriate height, along with the top image.
